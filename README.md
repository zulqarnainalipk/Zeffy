## 3. Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ (Python 3.11 recommended for the development environment)
*   `pip` for package installation

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable)**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd zeffy-automl-pipeline
    ```
    (If Zeffy is distributed as a package, this step might be different, e.g., direct pip install from PyPI or a wheel file.)

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .zeffy_env
    source .zeffy_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .zeffy_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Zeffy relies on several powerful libraries. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file (or a `pyproject.toml` if using Poetry/PDM).

    A minimal `requirements.txt` would include:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    pyyaml
    pydantic
    lightgbm
    xgboost
    catboost
    torch # For neural network support
    # optuna # For hyperparameter tuning
    # shap # For model explainability
    # Other specific dependencies for data loaders, etc.
    ```

    Install using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: For PyTorch, it is often recommended to install it separately following instructions from the official PyTorch website (pytorch.org) to get the version compatible with your CUDA setup if GPU support is needed. The example `requirements.txt` might specify a CPU-only version for broader compatibility initially.*

4.  **Verify Installation**
    (Once Zeffy has a CLI or a simple test script)
    ```bash
    # python -m zeffy --version # (Hypothetical CLI command)
    ```
    Or by importing in Python:
    ```python
    try:
        from zeffy import ZeffyPipeline
        print("Zeffy imported successfully!")
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"Error importing Zeffy: {e}")
    ```

(Detailed schema for each configuration object will be maintained, possibly with JSON schemas or Pydantic model exports.)

## 6. Error Handling

Zeffy uses a custom exception hierarchy to provide clear and specific error messages. All Zeffy-specific exceptions inherit from `ZeffyError`.

Key custom exceptions include:

*   `ZeffyConfigurationError`: For issues with the configuration file or parameters.
*   `ZeffyDataError`: For problems during data loading, validation, or processing.
*   `ZeffyModelError`: For errors related to model initialization, training, or prediction.
    *   `ZeffyNotFittedError`: If `predict` or `evaluate` is called before `fit`.
*   `ZeffyPreprocessingError`: For errors in preprocessing steps.
*   `ZeffyFeatureEngineeringError`: For errors in feature engineering.
*   `ZeffyTuningError`: For HPO related errors.
*   `ZeffyEnsemblingError`: For errors during ensembling.
*   `ZeffyEvaluationError`: For issues during metric calculation or evaluation.
*   `ZeffyExplainabilityError`: For errors in generating model explanations.

When an error occurs, Zeffy aims to:
1.  Raise the most specific exception possible.
2.  Provide a clear message indicating the nature of the problem.
3.  Offer context or suggestions for fixing the issue where possible.
4.  Log detailed error information (including stack traces in DEBUG mode) to the configured log file or console.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

*   **Check Configuration**: Many errors stem from incorrect or incomplete configuration files. Validate your YAML/JSON structure and parameter values against the expected schema (refer to Pydantic models in `zeffy/config/models.py`).
*   **Verify Data**: Ensure your input data matches the expectations (format, required columns, data types).
*   **Inspect Logs**: Zeffy's logs (especially at DEBUG level) can provide detailed insights into the pipeline's execution and the point of failure.
*   **Dependency Issues**: Ensure all required libraries are installed correctly and are compatible.
*   **Resource Limits**: For large datasets or complex models (especially NNs), monitor system resources (CPU, memory, GPU memory).

## 7. How Zeffy Works (High-Level Architecture)

Zeffy operates as a pipeline, processing data and training models through a sequence of configurable stages:

1.  **Configuration Loading**: The pipeline starts by loading and validating the user-provided configuration (YAML/JSON) using Pydantic models. This defines all subsequent steps.

2.  **Logging Setup**: Based on the configuration, a logger is initialized to record pipeline events.

3.  **Data Loading & Initial Validation (`zeffy.data`)**: Data is loaded from the specified source. Basic validation (e.g., presence of target column, initial type checks) is performed.

4.  **Preprocessing (`zeffy.preprocessing`)**: The data undergoes a series of user-defined preprocessing steps. Each step is a modular component (e.g., imputer, scaler, encoder). Categorical and numerical features are typically handled separately based on configuration.

5.  **Feature Engineering (`zeffy.feature_engineering`)**: New features are generated, and/or existing features are selected or transformed to improve model performance. This can include automated synthesis, interaction terms, and dimensionality reduction.

6.  **Model Training & Hyperparameter Optimization (`zeffy.models`, `zeffy.tuning`)**:
    *   One or more models specified in the configuration are initialized.
    *   If HPO is enabled, Zeffy uses the chosen optimizer (e.g., Optuna) to search for the best hyperparameters for the selected model(s) within the defined search space, optimizing for a specified metric using cross-validation.
    *   The best model(s) (with optimal hyperparameters) are then re-trained on the full training data (or on each fold for CV predictions).
    *   For neural networks, this stage involves defining the architecture (from file, class, or dict), setting up the optimizer and loss function, and running the training loop (epochs, batches).

7.  **Cross-Validation (`zeffy.evaluation`)**: Throughout training and HPO, models are evaluated using the specified cross-validation strategy to get robust performance estimates and generate out-of-fold (OOF) predictions.

8.  **Ensembling (`zeffy.ensembling`)**: If enabled, predictions from multiple models (or multiple folds/seeds of a single model) are combined using methods like averaging, stacking, or blending to potentially improve overall performance and robustness.

9.  **Evaluation (`zeffy.evaluation`)**: The final model (or ensemble) is evaluated on a holdout test set (if provided) or using the OOF predictions from cross-validation. Configured metrics are calculated and reported.

10. **Model Explainability (`zeffy.explainability`)**: If enabled, techniques like SHAP are used to generate feature importances and explanations for the final model's predictions.

11. **Saving Artifacts (`zeffy.utils.serialization`, `ZeffyPipeline.save_pipeline`)**: The trained pipeline (including preprocessors, models, configurations) and other artifacts (logs, predictions, evaluation results) are saved to the specified `results_path`.

**Core Components:**

*   **`ZeffyPipeline`**: The main orchestrator class that manages the pipeline execution flow.
*   **Configuration Models (`zeffy.config.models`)**: Pydantic models defining the structure and validation rules for configuration files.
*   **Module Implementations**: Each stage (e.g., `zeffy.models.classification.LightGBMClassifier`) is implemented as a Python class, often inheriting from a base class (e.g., `BaseModel`).
*   **Model Registry (`zeffy.models.registry`)**: Allows for dynamic registration and instantiation of model classes.

## 8. Extensibility

Zeffy is designed to be extensible. Users can add custom components:

*   **Custom Models**: Create a new class inheriting from `zeffy.models.base_model.BaseModel` and implement the required methods (`fit`, `predict`, `predict_proba`). Register it using the `@register_model("your_model_name")` decorator.
*   **Custom Preprocessing Steps**: (Details TBD - likely involve a base preprocessor class).
*   **Custom Feature Generators/Selectors**: (Details TBD).
*   **Custom Evaluation Metrics**: (Details TBD - likely involve a function signature).
*   **Custom Data Loaders**: (Details TBD).

Refer to the specific base classes and registry mechanisms within the Zeffy codebase for detailed instructions on how to add new components.

## 9. Use Cases

Zeffy can be applied to a wide variety of machine learning tasks, including but not limited to:

*   **Binary Classification**: Credit scoring, fraud detection, churn prediction, medical diagnosis.
*   **Multi-class Classification**: Image categorization (with appropriate feature extraction), document classification, object recognition.
*   **Regression**: House price prediction, sales forecasting, stock price prediction, demand forecasting.
*   **Tasks requiring advanced feature engineering and model tuning** for optimal performance.
*   **Rapid prototyping and benchmarking** of different modeling approaches.
*   **Educational purposes** for learning about AutoML pipeline components.

## 10. Future Development (Roadmap - Conceptual)

*   Full implementation of all planned preprocessing and feature engineering modules.
*   Expanded HPO library support (Hyperopt, Ray Tune).
*   Advanced ensembling strategies (e.g., more sophisticated stacking, blending options).
*   GUI or Web Interface for pipeline configuration and monitoring.
*   Integration with MLOps tools (e.g., MLflow for experiment tracking).
*   Support for distributed training (Dask, Ray).
*   More comprehensive data loaders (SQL databases, cloud storage).
*   Automated report generation with visualizations.
*   Enhanced time-series specific components.
